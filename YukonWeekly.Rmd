## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
# Create a data frame with sample data
data <- data.frame(
  Name = c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David"),
  Age = c(24, 30, 22, 35),
  Occupation = c("Engineer", "Doctor", "Artist", "Lawyer")
)

# Create a flextable object
ft <- flextable(data)

# Apply conditional formatting
ft <- ft %>%
  bg(i = ~ Age > 25, j = "Age", bg = "lightcoral") %>%
  bg(i = ~ Age < 30, j = "Age", bg = "palegreen") %>%
  color(i = ~ Age > 25, j = "Age", color = "white") %>%
  color(i = ~ Age < 30, j = "Age", color = "black")

# Print the table
ft
```
